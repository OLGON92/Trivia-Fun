## Description

_This is my sixth project for Epicodus that is meant to show off my understanding of API calls. The user will enter a number, a country's ISO 4217 code, then another country's ISO 4217 code, and then click submit to find out the initial country's amount converted into the second country's currency. Here is a [link](https://github.com/OLGON92/Currency-Converter) to the repository on GitHub._
