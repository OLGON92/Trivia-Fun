## Description

_This is our first teamweek project for Epicodus. The purpose of this exercise is to teach us how to work in a dev team to eventually prepare us for a real world situation. The rules are pretty simple: You will have 10 questions, 4 different choices, and you will be given a score depending on how many you get right. Here is a [link](https://github.com/OLGON92/Trivia-Fun) to the repository on GitHub._

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* _Clone the repository using this link: [link](https://github.com/OLGON92/Trivia-Fun)_
* _Navigate to the 'pop-trivia' directory on your computer_
* _Open it with your favorite text editor (Visual Studio Code is one I highly reccomend)_
* _To start a development server and view the project in the browser follow the steps below:_
* _Navigate to 'pop-trivia' in your command line_
* _Run the command "npm install" to install dependencies_
* _Optionally, run the command "npm run build" to bundle the files_
* _Finally, run the command "npm run start" to start a development server_
* _To run tests, navigate to 'pop-trivia' in your terminal and run the command "npm run test". Just as a heads-up this project does not have any tests as it was not needed for this project._
* _You do not need an API key to use this program, but you are more than welcome to use an API that uses an API Key._
* _Follow the steps below if you do want to use an API Key:_
* _Search for a Trivia API on google_
* _Find one that has good documentation, and one that utilizes an API Key_
* _You will signup with your email when you find one that you like._
* _You will then receive a personalized API key._
* _Create a .env file in the top level of the directory for 'pop-trivia' using your console_
* _Navigate to the .env file._
* _Inside the file set API_KEY equal to the personalized API Key you received earlier. E.g API_KEY=8675309_
* _You may also test your API call using an API tester. My personal favorite is Postman._

## Known Bugs

* _Still a work in progress._
